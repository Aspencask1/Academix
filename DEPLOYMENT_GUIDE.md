# Academix Deployment Guide

## Netlify Deployment Configuration

### Problem Solved

The build was failing due to ESLint peer dependency conflicts when deploying to Netlify.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Updated `netlify.toml`**:
   - Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to the build command
   - Set `NPM_FLAGS` environment variable
   - Ensured proper Node.js version (18)

2. **Updated `package.json`**:
   - Added `prebuild` script to install dependencies with legacy peer deps
   - This ensures consistent installation across environments

3. **Created `.npmrc`**:
   - Set `legacy-peer-deps=true` for consistent npm behavior
   - Added `save-exact=true` for reproducible builds

4. **Optimized ESLint Configuration**:
   - Updated `eslint.config.js` to be more compatible
   - Added proper ignore patterns for build directories
   - Simplified configuration to avoid conflicts

### Build Process

The build now follows this sequence:

1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (via prebuild script)
2. `vite build` (main build process)
3. Output to `build/` directory

### Bundle Analysis

Current build output:

- **Total Size**: ~1.2MB (gzipped ~400KB)
- **Vendor**: 441KB (React, etc.)
- **MUI**: 386KB (Material-UI components)
- **Features**: 114KB (app features)
- **Swiper**: 93KB (carousel library)
- **Entities**: 49KB (shared entities)
- **Query**: 38KB (React Query)
- **Other chunks**: Optimally split

### Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Code splitting implemented
- ✅ Lazy loading for routes
- ✅ Vendor chunk separation
- ✅ MUI chunk optimization
- ✅ Unused imports removed
- ✅ Build optimizations in Vite config

### Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Image Optimization**: Use WebP format and implement lazy loading
2. **Service Worker**: Add caching for better offline experience
3. **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for static assets
4. **Monitoring**: Implement performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals)

### Troubleshooting

If build issues persist:

1. Clear Netlify cache
2. Check Node.js version compatibility
3. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
4. Review ESLint configuration for conflicts

### Commands for Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build locally
npm run build

# Serve built files
npm run serve
```

The site should now deploy successfully on Netlify with improved performance and no ESLint conflicts.

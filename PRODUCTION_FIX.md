# Production Fix: useLayoutEffect Error Resolution

## Problem

The production site was showing a black screen with the error:

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useLayoutEffect')
at mui-B0hEWguy.js:8:18642
```

## Root Cause

This error was caused by:

1. **Version incompatibilities** between React 18.3.1 and MUI v6.4.12
2. **Hydration mismatches** between server-side and client-side rendering
3. **Missing error boundaries** to catch and handle React errors gracefully

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Package Dependencies**

Downgraded to compatible versions:

```json
{
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "@mui/material": "^5.15.6",
  "@mui/icons-material": "^5.15.6",
  "@emotion/react": "^11.11.1",
  "@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0"
}
```

### 2. **Added Error Boundary**

Created `ErrorBoundary` component to catch React errors:

- Catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree
- Logs error information
- Displays fallback UI instead of crashing
- Provides reload functionality

### 3. **Added Client-Only Wrapper**

Created `ClientOnly` component to prevent hydration issues:

- Ensures MUI components only render on the client side
- Prevents server-side rendering mismatches
- Provides loading fallback during hydration

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**

Updated `main.tsx` with:

- Try-catch wrapper around React rendering
- Fallback UI for initialization errors
- Proper error logging

### 5. **Updated Theme Provider**

Modified `ThemeProvider` to use `ClientOnly` wrapper:

- Prevents MUI theme hydration issues
- Ensures consistent client-side rendering

## Files Modified

1. **`package.json`** - Updated dependency versions
2. **`src/shared/components/ErrorBoundary/index.tsx`** - New error boundary component
3. **`src/shared/components/ClientOnly/index.tsx`** - New client-only wrapper
4. **`src/shared/components/index.ts`** - Added exports for new components
5. **`src/app/App.tsx`** - Wrapped app with ErrorBoundary
6. **`src/main.tsx`** - Added error handling and fallback rendering
7. **`src/app/providers/theme-management/ThemeProvider/index.tsx`** - Added ClientOnly wrapper

## Build Results

- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ MUI bundle reduced from 386KB to 245KB
- ✅ All chunks properly optimized
- ✅ No ESLint errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test in Production Environment**:
   - Deploy to Netlify
   - Test on different browsers
   - Test on mobile devices

2. **Monitor Error Logs**:
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Monitor error boundary catches

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Verify page load times
   - Check Core Web Vitals
   - Test user interactions

## Prevention Measures

1. **Version Compatibility**: Always use compatible versions of React and MUI
2. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries at key component levels
3. **Client-Side Rendering**: Use ClientOnly wrapper for components with browser APIs
4. **Testing**: Test in production-like environments before deployment

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated build to Netlify
2. Monitor for any remaining errors
3. Consider implementing performance monitoring
4. Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for production monitoring

The site should now load properly without the black screen issue.

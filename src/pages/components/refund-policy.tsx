      <p style={{ fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#666' }}><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025</p>

      <p>At Edunova, we strive to provide high-quality educational services and training programs. To maintain fairness and ensure the best experience for all users, this Refund and Cancellation Policy governs your ability to cancel orders or request refunds for courses or services purchased on our platform.</p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#007bff', marginTop: '30px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p>Cancellation requests will be accepted only within <strong>3 days of placing the order or enrolling in a course</strong>. Any cancellation requests received after this period will not be entertained under any circumstances.</p>
      <p>Once your enrollment has been confirmed and course access has been granted, cancellation or withdrawal requests will be strictly not accepted, as digital content access and course materials are immediately available.</p>
      <p>If the course involves live sessions, cancellation is not possible once the sessions have started.</p>
      <p>In case you have opted for physical material (like printed books or kits), cancellation may not be allowed once the order is dispatched or handed over to the courier.</p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#007bff', marginTop: '30px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>2. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>Refunds are generally not provided for digital products, online courses, or training services once access has been granted or the course has commenced.</p>
      <p>Refund requests will be considered only under exceptional circumstances, such as technical issues preventing course access, provided that the issue has been reported to Edunovaâ€™s support team within <strong>48 hours of purchase</strong>.</p>
      <p>Refund requests must be submitted in writing to our support team at <a href="mailto:support@edunova.com" style={{ color: '#007bff', textDecoration: 'none' }}>support@edunova.com</a> along with detailed reasons and any relevant evidence.</p>
      <p>If approved, refunds will be processed within <strong>30 business days</strong>. Please note, refund approval is at the sole discretion of Edunova management.</p>
      <p>No refunds will be given for dissatisfaction due to course content, learning pace, or personal circumstances.</p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#007bff', marginTop: '30px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>3. Reporting Issues and Complaints</h2>
      <p>If you experience any technical problems, course content discrepancies, or service failures, you must report them within <strong>7 days of purchase</strong>.</p>
      <p>Edunova will investigate all complaints diligently. If the complaint is valid and cannot be resolved, we may consider offering a partial refund or alternative solutions.</p>
      <p>For courses that include third-party certifications or external resources, please refer to the respective providers' policies for claims or complaints.</p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#007bff', marginTop: '30px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>4. No-Show Policy for Live or Instructor-Led Sessions</h2>
      <p>In case of live classes, webinars, or instructor-led training, if you miss sessions without prior intimation, no refunds or rescheduling will be provided.</p>
      <p>Rescheduling of live sessions may be considered only with prior approval and under exceptional circumstances, communicated at least <strong>48 hours in advance</strong>.</p>
